#The Case of the Girl in the Red Dress
-----------------------------------------------------
She entered like a star, dress red like flames straight outta hell. 

I knew she was trouble, but it did me no good. 

Two days later here I am, waking up in a haze; no idea where am I or how I got here.

I only know one thing:
I have to find that girl in the red dress..
